This project is with the Rubin lab. They did a screen of hundreds of chemicals
and want to find chemicals that cause muscle stem cells called satellite cells
to differentiate into muscle cells called myoblasts. There are five 384 well
plates with around 300 chemicals tested in each one. Plates 4 and 5 are
technical replicates of each other because the sequencing was shallow on plate 4.
The other plates are biological replicates.

There is a protein that is known to initiate this process called Myod. There
are MyoD wells in each plate which can serve as a positive control. There
are also cells with just DMSO which serve as a negative control.

The cells have been treated for only a small amount of time, just 48 hours.
I am under the impression that only 48 hours of treatment with Myod should
not induce terminal differentiation into myoblasts but instead just start
the cells along that process.

They have a plate of cells that are just satellite cells and just myoblasts. If
we combine all of the data together, we would ideally like to see a set of
chemicals that are moving the expression profile of the treated satellite cells
closer to that of the myoblast cells. We would expect the Myod treated wells to
be somewhere in between the satellite and myoblasts.

Feodor also mentioned that plate 3 didn't seem to cluster with the other plates.
So part of a secondary objective is to try to figure out what is wrong with
plate 3.

This is a pilot project so suggestions about improving the process will be
helpful.

The code for this report is on github [here](https://github.com/hbc/rubin-cell-fate-conversion).


```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy=TRUE, highlight=TRUE, dev="png",
               cache=TRUE, highlight=TRUE, autodep=TRUE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE,
               message=FALSE, prompt=TRUE, comment='', fig.cap='')
```
```{r load-libaries}
library(useful)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(MASS)
```

Read in the data for each plate into one big dataframe, make unique IDs for
each batch/well combination and use those IDs as the column names.

```{r read-plates, eval=!file.exists("plates.RData")}
setwd("~/git/rubin-cell-fate-conversion")

plate_reader = function(fn) {
  batch = strsplit(basename(fn), ".", fixed=TRUE)[[1]][1]
  data = read.table(fn, header=TRUE, row.names=1)
  colnames(data) = paste(batch, colnames(data), sep="_")
  data
}
plates_fns = sort(list.files("data", pattern="*.dat", full.names=TRUE))
plates = do.call(cbind, lapply(plates_fns, plate_reader))
save(plates, file="plates.RData")
```

```{r load-plates}
load("plates.RData")
```

Create a dataframe of the metadata about each sample. This has an identifier
for a sample, Which well it came from, which batch and what it was treated with.

```{r massage-well-identity-data}
welldata_fn = "metadata/Compound Layout 384w.csv"
welldata = read_csv(welldata_fn) %>%
  gather(column, treatment, -row) %>%
  mutate(well=paste(row, column, sep="")) %>%
  dplyr::select(well, treatment)
identities = data.frame(str_split_fixed(colnames(plates), "_", 3))
colnames(identities) = c("batch", "drop", "well")
identities$id = colnames(plates)
welldata = identities %>% dplyr::select(batch, well) %>%
         left_join(welldata, by="well")
rownames(welldata) = colnames(plates)
welldata$sample = colnames(plates)
```


Verify that the samples match up between the read counts and the metadata dataframe
and make sure there are no NA counts.

```{r verify-data}
dim(welldata)
dim(plates)
table(rownames(welldata) %in% colnames(plates))
corner(plates)
corner(welldata)
table(complete.cases(plates))
```

Looks like we are good to go. While we're at it we will load the positive
control data.

```{r load-positive-control-data}
positive_fn = "metadata/Feo_positive_controls_modified.unq.refseq.umi.dat"
positive = read.table(positive_fn, header=TRUE, row.names=rownames(plates))
positive$id = NULL
positive_samples = data.frame(str_split_fixed(colnames(positive), "_", 3))
identities = data.frame(str_split_fixed(colnames(plates), "_", 3))$X1
positive_welldata = data.frame(batch=positive_samples$X1,
                               treatment=positive_samples$X1,
                               well=positive_samples$X1)

#Better to do it this way because positive_samples is actually a vector not a dataframe
positive_samples$X2 = "Fresh"
positive_samples$X3 = c(1,2,3,4,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9)
```

Now we will calculate some summary statistics about each sample.

```{r plot-genes-detected}
welldata$genes_detected = colSums(plates > 0)
welldata$genes_detected_zscore = ave(welldata$genes_detected, FUN=scale)
welldata$genes_detected_pval = 2 * pnorm(-abs(welldata$genes_detected_zscore))
welldata$genes_detected_padj = p.adjust(welldata$genes_detected_pval, method="BH")
outliers = subset(welldata, genes_detected_padj < 0.1)
ggplot(outliers, aes(treatment, genes_detected, fill=batch)) +
   geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge') +
   facet_wrap(~batch) +
   geom_hline(yintercept=ave(welldata$genes_detected), linetype="dashed") +
   ylab("genes with counts > 0") +
   xlab("") +
   theme_bw() +
   scale_x_discrete(breaks=NULL)
```

The M2 plate seems to have lower counts than the plates.

```{r low-counts-plate}
ggplot(welldata, aes(batch, genes_detected)) + geom_boxplot() +
   ylab("genes with counts > 0") +
   xlab("") +
   theme_bw()
```

We can see it in the boxplot.

```{r boxplot-counts-plate}
welldata$counts = colSums(plates)
ggplot(welldata, aes(batch, counts)) + geom_boxplot() +
   ylab("total counts") +
   xlab("") +
   theme_bw()
```

And the number of failed wells, where we call a well failed if it
had < 10,000 total counts.

```{r failed-wells}
welldata$failed = colSums(plates) < 10000
welldata %>% group_by(batch) %>% summarise(nfailed = sum(failed))
```

We can also see in an estimate of library complexity that the M2 library
is less complex than the other libraries.

```{r plot-complexity}
ggplot(welldata, aes(counts, genes_detected, color=batch)) +
   geom_smooth(fill=NA) +
   ylab("genes with counts > 0") +
   xlab("total counts") +
   theme_bw()
```

In this histogram of the genes detected, we can see there are a set of
samples with a low amount of genes detected.

```{r genes-detected-histogram}
ggplot(welldata, aes(genes_detected)) + geom_histogram() +
   theme_bw() + xlab("genes with counts > 0")
```

Here we drop those samples, using a cutoff of 7,500 genes.

```{r drop-low-genes-detected}
welldata = subset(welldata, genes_detected > 7500)
plates = plates[, rownames(welldata)]
```

```{r biomart-conversions}
library(biomaRt)
mouse = useMart(biomart = "ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL",
                dataset="mmusculus_gene_ensembl",
                host = "jul2015.archive.ensembl.org")
conversions = getBM(attributes=c("ensembl_gene_id", "mgi_symbol", "gene_biotype"),
                    mart=mouse)
```

Samples do not have very many counts in noise genes, so that is not an issue.
Noise genes are flagged by either being too small to be picked up reliably in a
standard RNA-seq analysis or are highly variable and prone to introducing
distortion such as rRNA.

```{r add-noise-counts}
biotypes = unique(conversions$gene_biotype)
noise_rna_biotypes = c("Mt_tRNA", "Mt_rRNA", "snoRNA", "snRNA", "misc_RNA",
                       "scaRNA", "rRNA", "sRNA")
noise_rna_genes = subset(conversions, gene_biotype %in% noise_rna_biotypes)$mgi_symbol
noise_rna = rownames(plates)[rownames(plates) %in% noise_rna_genes]
welldata$noise_counts = colSums(plates[noise_rna,])
ggplot(welldata, aes(batch, noise_counts)) + geom_boxplot() +
   ylab("counts in noise genes") +
   xlab("") +
   theme_bw()
```

We'll drop the noise genes from consideration even though there aren't many
counts in them.

```{r drop-noise-genes}
plates = plates[!rownames(plates) %in% noise_rna_genes,]
```

We'll also drop all genes with that don't have at least 100 counts total and
are not seen in at least 4 samples. This cuts down the number of genes we
are considering to ~13,500.

```{r drop-low-genes}
plates = plates[rowSums(plates > 0) > 4 & rowSums(plates) > 100,]
```

This is what we're left with in terms of samples:

```{r filtering-finish}
knitr::kable(welldata %>% group_by(batch) %>% summarize(total=n()))
```

and we're left with `r nrow(plates)` genes to consider.

The DESeq2 PCA is a little bit limited, it doesn't return the higher order
principal components and we are going to do t-SNE anyway
later on, so we'll load these counts into Seurat which has a more flexible
PCA implementation and also has a t-SNE implementation. We'll first look
at this data to try to figure out what is up with TCL3.

```{r seurat-setup}
library(Seurat)
seurat.raw.data = data.frame(log(plates + 1))
seurat.data = new('seurat', raw.data=seurat.raw.data)
seurat.data = setup(seurat.data, project="rubin", min.cells=1, min.genes=1000,
                    is.expr=1, meta.data=welldata)
```

Here we look at what are the most variable genes across the samples. We can
see a lot of these are subunits of ribosomal proteins, these will be used
for the PCA.

```{r mean-var-plot}
seurat.data = mean.var.plot(seurat.data, y.cutoff = 2, x.low.cutoff = 2,
                            fxn.x = expMean,fxn.y = logVarDivMean)
```

We'll focus on component 1 since that seems to be what separates out
the TCL3 plate from the other plates.

```{r pca-plot}
seurat.data = pca(seurat.data, do.print=FALSE)
pca.plot(seurat.data, 1, 2, pt.size=2)
pcHeatmap(seurat.data, pc.use = 1, do.balanced = FALSE)
```

There are quite a few ribosomal proteins that are flagged. These should for the
most part eithr be stably expressed or are not particularly interesting hits.

Since TCL3 is so different, and it seems different in non-interesting
ways, let's just drop it for now to make out lives easier.

```{r drop-tcl3}
welldata = subset(welldata, batch != "M3")
plates = plates[, rownames(welldata)]
seurat.raw.data = data.frame(log(plates + 1))
seurat.data = new('seurat', raw.data=seurat.raw.data)
seurat.data = setup(seurat.data, project="rubin", min.cells=1, min.genes=1000,
                    is.expr=1, meta.data=welldata)
seurat.data = mean.var.plot(seurat.data, y.cutoff = 2, x.low.cutoff = 2,
                            fxn.x = expMean,fxn.y = logVarDivMean)
seurat.data = pca(seurat.data, do.print=FALSE)
pca.plot(seurat.data, 1, 2, pt.size=2)
seurat.data = project.pca(seurat.data, do.print = FALSE)
viz.pca(seurat.data, pcs.use = 1:3, num.genes = 10, use.full = TRUE, nCol = 3)
```

After dropping TCL3 we'll write out all of the gene symbols that are expressed--
this is a useful background for doing a GO ontology analysis later on.


```{r write-expressed-genes}
write.table(rownames(plates), file="expressed.txt", quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
```

To further simplify, lets make this a very simple problem. We want to find
chemicals that make the samples look more like the Myod treated samples than
the DMSO alone treated samples. We'll do that by picking out only the
Myod and DMSO samples, doing PCA and finding the genes most strongly associated
with whatever component separates out the Myod and DMSO samples.

```{r just-dmso-myod-subset}
simpledata = subset(welldata, treatment %in% c("DMSO", "AdMyoD"))
simpledata$sample = rownames(simpledata)
simple = plates[, rownames(simpledata)]
simple.raw.data = data.frame(log(simple + 1))
simple.data = new('seurat', raw.data=simple.raw.data)
simple.data = setup(simple.data, project="rubin", min.cells=1, min.genes=1000,
                    is.expr=1, meta.data=simpledata)
simple.data = mean.var.plot(simple.data, y.cutoff = 2, x.low.cutoff = 2,
                            fxn.x = expMean,fxn.y = logVarDivMean)
simple.data = pca(simple.data, do.print=FALSE)

rot = simple.data@pca.rot %>%
  add_rownames(var="sample")  %>%
  left_join(simpledata, by="sample")
```

We can see that PC1 separates out the AdMyoD and DMSO samples and there is
also an effect of batch along PC2.

```{r pca-just-dmso-myod}
ggplot(rot, aes(PC1, PC2, shape=treatment, color=batch)) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  theme_bw()
```

The GO ontology graph of terms enriched for the top 100 genes with the largest
weights in PC1 makes a lot of sense. This figure is from
[WebGestalt](http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/) using as a background
set all expressed genes.

```{r pc1-top-100-genes}
components = simple.data@pca.x
components = components[order(-abs(components$PC1)),]
write.table(head(rownames(components), 100), file="myo-vs-dmso-pc1.txt", quote=FALSE,
            row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
```

![](images/GO-ontology-top-100-AdMyoD-vs-DMSO.gif)

There is also a clear separation along PC2 with some GO enrichment for terms
involved in differentiation. Here we took just the top 50 because the GO terms
beyond that had a low weighting in PC2. Could the cells be in different
states of differentiation from the get-go?

```{r pc2-top-50-genes}
write.table(head(rownames(components)[order(-abs(components$PC2))], 50),
            file="myo-vs-dmso-pc2.txt", quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
```

![](images/GO-ontology-top-50-PC2-AdMyoD-vs-DMSO.gif)

So now we have a set of genes along PC1 that we can use to do PCA with all of
the chemicals.

```{r original-pca}
seurat.data = pca(seurat.data, pc.genes=rownames(components))
welldata$classes = ifelse(welldata$treatment == "DMSO", "DMSO",
      ifelse(welldata$treatment == "AdMyoD", "AdMyoD", "other"))
rot = seurat.data@pca.rot %>%
  add_rownames(var="sample")  %>%
  left_join(welldata, by="sample")
ggplot(rot, aes(PC1, PC2, color=classes, label=treatment)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  geom_text(size=3) +
  theme_bw()
```

Nothing really clusters with Myod, but there might be some chemicals moving
towards it if we zoom in on the sector closest to the AdMyoD samples:

```{r zoomed-pca}
ggplot(rot, aes(PC1, PC2, color=batch, label=treatment)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0.00, 0.05), ylim=c(-0.06, 0.05)) +
  geom_text(size=2) +
  theme_bw()
```

Repsox, SB43152, CP-673451 and CHIR-124 all look like good hits and there are
others in there along that front closest to AdMyoD.

I tried being fancy and projecting to get more genes rather than just looking
at a hard cutoff for PC1, but it didn't work as well. There might not be
enough cells to do the jackstraw with these samples, you can see the jackstraw
plots look weird.

```{r project-all}
simple.data = project.pca(simple.data, do.print = FALSE)
projected = simple.data@pca.x.full
projected = projected[order(-abs(projected$PC1)),]

simple.data = jackStraw(simple.data, num.replicate=1000, prop.freq=0.025)
jackStrawPlot(simple.data)
simple.data = project.pca(simple.data, do.print = FALSE,do.center=FALSE)
genes.sig = pca.sig.genes(simple.data, pcs.use=c(1, 2), pval.cut = 0.001, use.full=TRUE)
write.table(genes.sig, file="pc1-jackstraw-sig.txt",
quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
```

Doing a GO ontology on those genes pulls out some more salient terms.

![](images/GO-ontology-jackstraw-PC1.gif)

So we can try using these genes to do PCA as well.

```{r pca-sig-genes}
simple.data=pca(simple.data, pc.genes=genes.sig)
rot = simple.data@pca.rot %>%
  add_rownames(var="sample")  %>%
  left_join(simpledata, by="sample")
ggplot(rot, aes(PC1, PC2, shape=treatment, color=batch)) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  theme_bw()
```

This improves the look of the PCA, it now separates on the first and
second principal components. Now if we go back to the original data,
we can see that Myod treatment separates from the other treatments.

```{r full-pca-sig-genes}
seurat.data=pca(seurat.data, pc.genes=genes.sig)
rot = seurat.data@pca.rot %>%
  add_rownames(var="sample")  %>%
  left_join(welldata, by="sample")
ggplot(rot, aes(PC1, PC2, label=treatment, color=batch)) +
  geom_text(size=2) +
  theme_bw()
```

Zooming in, we can maybe pick out a few more chemicals that have an effect.

```{r full-pca-sig-genes-zoomed}
ggplot(rot, aes(PC1, PC2, color=batch, label=treatment)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(-0.075, 0.00), ylim=c(-0.06, 0.05)) +
  geom_text(size=2) +
  theme_bw()
```
